# NamedEntityRecognition
Identifying Name, entity, GPE etc using nltk and spacy in python

During the process of learning Natural Language Processing using python I, came across the concept of identifying entity name, location, 
organization etc.
I have understood the process of extracting this details from a document using Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) and by using a library 
called spacy
The code involves steps to tokenize the input data, apply pos tagging and then extract the name entity information.

This information is useful to extract information that helps to locate and classify named entities in text into predefined categories 
such as names of persons, organization, locations, expression of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages etc.
